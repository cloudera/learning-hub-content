- title: New AMP - LLM Chatbot Augmented with Enterprise Data
  description: |-
    This new AMP demonstrates how enterprises can seamlessly integrate their own documentation with an LLM to generate more accurate, factual responses, thus creating their own subject matter expert ChatBot. This is all accomplished without a single external API call, running everything within CML.     
    
    To give it a try, simply navigate to the AMP Catalog and select the new LLM AMP. If you don't see the AMP, ask your administrator to go to 'Site Administration > AMPs' and refresh the catalog. This AMP requires NVIDIA GPUs, if you don't have access to them, work with your administrator to enable them.

- title: New "Add Data" feature to simplifies data ingestion
  description: |-
    The new "Add Data" action on CML’s Data Connections allows users to easily upload data into CDP. This new capability simplifies the process of bringing data to CDP and enables Data Scientists to directly ingest their data without depending on administrators or data engineers.
    
    To get started with this feature, you can simply open the “Data” tab in your CML Project and click on the "Add Data" action on the CDP Data Connection you wish to use, and follow the prompts to upload their data into a CDP Data Store.

- title: Simplify Data Access with Custom Connection Support in CML
  description: |-
    The new Custom Connection Support enables data scientists to seamlessly connect to external data stores from within CML. This feature helps data scientists discover all of their data independently, without worrying about implementation and connectivity details, unlocking their machine learning use cases from the get-go.
    
    Custom Connections need to be configured by Administrators to make connections to legacy on-prem databases (Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL), serverless cloud databases (Redshift, Snowflake, SAP HANA Cloud, BigQuery), APIs, or specialized data stores (Neo4j).
    If you have requirements for external data, you can work with your Administrator to get them enabled.

- title: PBJ Workbench Runtimes
  description: |-
    The new ML Runtimes release ship the GA version of the new workbench architecture, the PBJ (Powered by Jupyter) Workbench. In the previous Workbench editor, a Cloudera-specific custom messaging protocol was used as a communication channel between CML and Runtimes. PBJ Runtimes use Jupyter components, so user code and third-party libraries are more consistent with their behavior in Jupyter-based environments. This enables a wider variety of rich visualization libraries out of the box, brings easier troubleshooting, and fewer dependency conflicts. 
    For example, Python 3's input() function now works. Go ahead and try it out!

- title: Iceberg connection support
  description: |- 
    While businesses adopt and build their open lakehouse built with Apache Iceberg on CDP they need ease of data access so data scientists don’t need to spend their time figuring out connection dependencies and configurations.

    CML’s Data Connection and Snippet support simplify data access in CDP. Data scientists can use the cml.data library to gain access to the Data Lake via Spark or query their Virtual Warehouse with Hive or Impala. With recent improvements to the cml.data library, CML Snippets now fully support the Iceberg table format for all Spark, Hive, and Impala data connections.

  description: |-
    The Data Discovery and Visualization experience ships with preconfigured Data Connections, a database browser, interactive SQL editor, drag-and-drop Visual Dashboarding, and Connection Snippets.
    These new capabilities speed up the development process by cutting down the time spent on finding, exploring, understanding, and accessing the data. Data Scientists need to fully understand their data in order to properly analyze it, build models, and power ML use cases. To reduce friction between the different steps of discovery and exploration and support collaboration within the data science team, CML ships all tools to accelerate the data science process and reduce the time to insights.

- title: Data Connections and Snippets
  description: |-
    Cloudera Machine Learning now offers Snippet to connect to Data Sources available within the CDP Environment. Administrators can configure custom Spark, Hive or Impala Virtual Warehouse data connections manually or they can use CML’s features to autodetect and configure all connections from the same CDP Environment. Data Scientists can then access the preconfigured Data Connections from their ML Projects.

    The Data Connection and Snippet support simplifies getting started on ML Projects. Once a Project is created, the first time the users create a session they are offered code snippets to create a connection to their selected data store. Users don’t need to look up the connection boilerplate from the documentation or copy an example code from other projects, they can easily initiate the connection via CML’s connection library and immediately start solving their business problems.

- title: Project-level ML Runtime configuration in CML
  description: "Project-level configuration for ML Runtimes adds the ability to limit
    the available Runtime selection for a particular project. Users, project owners
    who would like to have more control over the available ML Runtimes for their project,
    or would like to keep up to date with new ML Runtimes, can now specify the preferred
    list of images available for a project.\n\nWith the broad set of released ML Runtimes
    and available customization options, choosing the right Runtime for a project
    might be difficult and project owners might prefer controlling the available options
    themselves. This feature available from the user interface now gives a convenient
    way to limit the available options by adding runtimes based on the supported Editor,
    Kernel, Edition and Version. It also provides a way to indicate and include newly
    released versions of the configured runtimes via a simple mouse click. \n\nTo
    get started, try creating a new project, where now Basic and Advanced options
    are available for selecting and pre-populating the project with the selected ML
    Runtimes. \n\nExisting projects can keep on using any Runtime that’s available
    in the Workspace until the list is not specified under the project settings."

- title: Cloudera Machine Learning APIv2
  description: |-
    Cloudera Machine Learning’s APIv2 enables automated project lifecycle management, CI/CD integration, and more.  APIv2 provides CML users with the ability to programmatically create, read, update and delete projects and workloads, including jobs, models and applications. This means that users can automate creation and setup of projects, or trigger actions such as retraining or deploying a new version of a model as part of the project lifecycle. All this is enabled from within the product or from an external scheduling or CI/CD tool, using the Python client library or HTTPS REST API.

    In addition to creating production-ready ML models and applications, machine learning engineers must also take those models and applications to production, which often involves deploying to a different environment. Further, these applications are rarely deployed once and left alone. Rather, many models will be updated with further versions as modellers continue to iterate, or as the profile of incoming data changes. These activities are challenging and susceptible to error if they can only be done manually through a UI. CML’s API now allows ML engineers to script these deployment and maintenance events, schedule or automate them, or integrate with external process and approval workflows by calling APIs based on a suitable trigger.

- title: Apache Spark 3 is now available in CML
  description: |-
    Cloudera Machine Learning now offers multi-version Spark support. Users of CML can select the Spark version they want to use for each workload. With multi-version Spark support, users now have access to Spark 3 and can take advantage of the 30% performance and stability improvements in the latest version of Spark (based on internal TPC-DS benchmarks).

    Data Scientists can run workloads in both Spark 2 and Spark 3 within the same CML Workspace, thus maintaining backwards compatibility with existing workloads while developing new applications on the latest version of Spark. Spark can be configured as a Runtime Addon per workload so users can migrate and test all of their scheduled jobs one-by-one within a single Project.
